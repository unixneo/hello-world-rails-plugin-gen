# hello-world-rails-plugin-gen

hello-world-rails-plugin-gen is a plugin for debugging the Discourse rails plugin generator

## Reference

[Discourse::Meta::Rails plugin generator](https://meta.discourse.org/t/rails-plugin-generator/95907)

## Key Details

- This plugin was generated with the Discourse rails plugin generator using

```
rails g plugin hello-world
```

- Added Rails lifecycle logging to `./log/hello_world_log.txt` to test the plugin generator and notice the Rails controllers were ignored (not working)

- Moved the Rails controllers up one directory and they worked as expected
